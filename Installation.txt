INTRODUCTION
 
The contents of this release duplicate the environment that we use at
Sierra Nevada College to support XLISP.
 
If you follow these instructions precisely, and if you have a conventional 
Windows XP environment, then your installation should proceed without a 
hitch. If you make an error during the installation procedure, or if you 
do not follow these instructions correctly, or if your environment is not 
Windows XP, then you are likely not to have a correctly running version 
of XLISP when you are done.
 
You only will need to perform this installation ONCE. after that, you 
will be prepared to use XLISP for all future coursework.
 
It is ASSUMED that YOU are sufficiently sophisticated and educated to 
support yourself in installing this software. If this is not the case, 
then we STRONGLY URGE YOU to contact your instructor for help. The SNC 
Help Desk is NOT prepared to support this software, or its installation.
 
It is VERY STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you install all software in the 
directory that we recommend.
 
Note: With the exception of WinZip (see below), all this software is 
free for personal use.
 
Most likely, it will be VERY CONVENIENT if you print a copy of these 
instructions before you begin. Then, check-off each step as it is 
completed.

=========================================================================
Follow these instructions, PRECISELY in this order, to install your copy 
of the SNC XLISP environment. If you do not properly follow aLL these 
instructions, your XLISP environment may be incomplete, it may "misbehave" 
in "strange and mysterious ways," and it may take considerable innovation 
and insight in order to correct the problems you encounter.
=========================================================================
=========================================================================
 
1.	System Requirements
 
To start, you will need at least 1.4 MB free space on your hard disk for 
the files included in this release.
 
after installation, you should have at least 100 MB free space on your 
hard disk in order to compile and execute XLISP programs. Your CPU 
should be a Pentium. It should run at least at 200 MHz. You computer 
should have at least 32 Meg RaM.
 
You MaY be able to "get away" with less...  However, performance may 
degrade to such a point that it just isn't worthwhile to use XLISP in 
such a minimal and unresponsive environment.
 
Note that essentially all computers purchased within the last few years
meets or exceeds these minimums.
 
=========================================================================
 
2.	Run SCANDISK
 
The very FIRST thing you should do, BEFORE installing any software, is 
to run SCANDISK on your system. This will ensure that your hard drive 
is free of cross-linked clusters and other defects that might interfere 
with a successful installation. 
 
Probably the easiest way to run SCANDISK is to click on My Computer,
then to right-click on drive C: and select Properties. 
Next, click the Tools tab. In Error Checking, click Check Now. In the 
Check Disk dialog, you probably should check both "automatically fix..." 
and "Scan for and attempt..."
 
=========================================================================
 
3.	Install WinZip
 
File:	winzip90.exe (or the current version of WinZip)
URL:	http://www.winzip.com
 
WinZip is one of the finest applications available today for both 
expanding and compressing files for transmission over the Internet (as 
well as for backup). WinZip is provided as "shareware." This means 
that you may try using WinZip for a reasonable period.  after that, you 
should either pay for it. a single copy costs about $30. It provides 
permanent lifetime use of WinZip and upgrades. You must have a properly 
installed UnZip application in order to install the XLISP environment.
 
You install WinZip by double-clicking the application, winzip81.exe.
 
Follow the on-screen instructions. The Express Setup works fine. Only 
select Custom Setup if you truly want to change one or more of the 
advanced options (not recommended). Once WinZip is installed (or any 
comparable UnZip product, or if you already have an UnZip product 
installed) you are ready to begin the installation of XLISP.
 
The rest of these instructions assume that you are familiar with running 
WinZip (or a comparable UnZip utility). If you are not familiar with 
how to unzip files from a ZIP archive, you should take a few minutes to 
learn how to do so. This expertise is REQUIRED in order to install the 
XLISP environment correctly.
 
Note: If you already have software that can both create and "unzip" ZIP 
archive files, you do not need to install WinZip.

Note: WinZip is one of the finest applications available today for both 
expanding and compressing files for transmission over the Internet (as 
well as for backup). WinZip is provided as "shareware." This means that
you may try using WinZip for a reasonable period. after that, you should
pay for it. a single copy costs about $30. alternative freeware Zip
utilities are available. Perhaps the best free Zipper/Unzipper available
today is FreeZip (http://members.ozemail.com.au/~nulifetv/freezip/).
You must have a properly installed UnZip application in order to install
the Java environment. An alternative to WinZip that many students prefer
to WinZip is WinRAR. There is a free version of WinRAR available. And,
it will handle both ZIP and RAR files equally well, both for compression
and for extraction. (http://www.rarlabs.com).
 
=========================================================================
 
4.	Install XLISP-PLUS 3.04
 
File:	XLISP-PLUS.zip
URL:    http://Snow.SierraNevada.edu/pub/SNCXLISP/
 
This Zip archive contains the entire XLISP-PLUS Version 3.04 environment.
(This Zip archive contains aLL the files in this directory. The files are
provided individually, in case you wish to download them one-at-a-time.)
There is no Windows installer, so you must perform the installation 
manually.

  a. Download XLISP-PLUS.zip and place the file on your desktop.
  b. Right-click XLISP-PLUS.zip, and select WinZip | Extract to folder
     C:...\XLISP-PLUS. Nine files will be extracted and placed in a
     folder named XLISP-PLUS, located on your desktop.
  c. Using Windows Explorer (or any other technique you like), MOVE this
     XLISP-PLUS folder beneath C:\Program Files.
  d. Open the XLISP-PLUS folder (whose full path now is
     C:\Program Files\XLISP-PLUS).
  e. You may now read the XLISP-PLUS manual (XLDOC.pdf) and explore the
     XLISP Help system (xlisp300.hlp).
  f. Drag the file (actually, the alias) named XLISP to your desktop.
  g. You might want to update your PATH variable to include the
     C:\Program Files\XLISP-PLUS directory. Then you can run XLISP from
     anywhere.
 
=========================================================================
 
5.	Test your installation
 
File:	Hello-World.lsp
 
Double-click on the XLISP icon on your desktop. XLISP should launch.
Click on File | Open/load...
Using the browser, go to the C:\Program Files\XLISP-PLUS folder.
Select the file Hello-World.lsp, and click Open.
    Type:  (Hello-World)  [Enter]
The Hello-World LISP function should execute, producing:
 
Hello Lisp World
 
        0
        1
        2
        3
        4
NIL
 
Type:  (exit)  [Enter]
XLISP should terminate.
 
In some versions of Windows the File | Open/Load menu command may not
work (properly). In this case you can:
    Type: (load "Hello-World.lsp")  [Enter]
    Type: (Hello-World)  [Enter]
at which point the Hello-World LISP function should execute as above.
See the documentation for information about the (load) function.

at this point your installation matches the one that we use at SNC. You 
are now ready to begin to learn and use XLISP.
 
=========================================================================
 
6.	Congratulations!

You have successfully installed a copy of the SNC XLISP environment on 
your PC. It matches the one that we will be using for demonstrations 
and in-class assignments. It is the one you should use for doing your 
homework assignments.

You now may discard the XLISP-PLUS.zip file if you wish -- you'll not
need it unless you need to install XLISP-PLUS again.
